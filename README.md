## About
- Wanted to see all Matomo in a table view and include pricing and download info to make it easier to review then from Matomo's plugin db - https://plugins.matomo.org/
- Merged in data from my install and the marketplace and some of the plugins in each are described and named differently so I think there are some dups in this table but okay for now (don't have time to fix now) and feel free to clean up and submit edits
